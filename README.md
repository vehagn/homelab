# 🪨 Homelab 🏡

Repository for home infrastructure and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster
using [GitOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) practices.

Held together using [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment),
[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/), [Talos](https://talos.dev), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/),
[Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) and copious amounts of [YAML](https://yaml.org/) with some help
from [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/).

## 📖 Overview

This repository hosts the IaC ([Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code))
configuration for my homelab.

The Homelab is backed by [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment) hypervisor nodes with VMs
bootstrapped using [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/)/[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

Most of the services run on [Talos](https://www.talos.dev/) flavoured [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/),
though I'm also running a [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/) VM for storage
and [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) VM for home automation.

To organise all the configuration I've opted for an approach using Kustomized Helm
with [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) which I've explained in more
detail [in this article](https://blog.stonegarden.dev/articles/2023/09/argocd-kustomize-with-helm/).

I journal my homelab journey over at my self-hosted [blog](https://blog.stonegarden.dev).

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

If you're new to Kubernetes I've written a fairly thorough guide
on [Bootstrapping k3s with Cilium](https://blog.stonegarden.dev/articles/2024/02/bootstrapping-k3s-with-cilium/).
In the article I try to guide you from a fresh Debian 12 Bookworm install to a working cluster using
the [k3s](https://k3s.io) flavour of Kubernetes with [Cilium](https://cilium.io) as a [CNI](https://www.cni.dev)
and [IngressController](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/).

I've also written an article on how to get started
with [Kubernetes on Proxmox](https://blog.stonegarden.dev/articles/2024/03/proxmox-k8s-with-cilium/) if virtualisation
is more your thing.

The current iteration of my homelab runs on [Talos](https://talos.dev) Kubernetes and is set up according 
to [this article](https://blog.stonegarden.dev/articles/2024/08/talos-proxmox-tofu/).
